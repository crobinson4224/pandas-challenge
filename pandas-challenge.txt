I noticed that Final critic is the most popular game and the game players spent

Also players that choose to not reveal their gender have a higher "Avg Purchase Total per Person"
than male and female spenders.

Lastly, it seems the gaming company's target audience is players between the ages of "20-24". They lead in 
the percentage of players and the amount of money they have spent.
